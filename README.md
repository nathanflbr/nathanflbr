# Hello, I'm Nathan. — Pleno Front-end

### Front-end Developer focused on React & TypeScript

I enjoy building web applications with modern technologies and learning along the way. I care about writing clean code, improving performance, and working well with teams to create great user experiences.

With a strong background in **UI Design**, I bridge the gap between design and engineering, translating complex requirements into robust, pixel-perfect code.

Throughout my journey, I've worked on challenging projects that taught me the importance of thoughtful component architecture and solid testing practices. I'm particularly interested in UI/UX design, accessibility, and performance optimization - always thinking about how to make applications faster and more inclusive for everyone.

I love solving complex problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces and collaborating with others to find the best solutions. Whether I'm refactoring legacy code, building new features from scratch, or debugging tricky issues, I approach every task with curiosity and attention to detail.
